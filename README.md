# Any Ghost

This Trackmania 2020 plugin allows you to search for any trackmania user (that exists inside trackmania.io) and quickly enable or disable their ghost to race against.

The default trackmania interface allows users (with club access) to enable ghosts in the top 5 rankings of a given category (world, region, country, etc) as well as players one rank above and one rank below them.
However there is no quick and easy way to add arbitrary user ghosts to race against.

This plugin solves that problem, so you can now quickly enable ghosts for your favourite trackmania streamers, even when they're not good enough to be top 5 world ;)

Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request if you have one.
